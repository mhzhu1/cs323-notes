This course is a graduate level introduction to automated reasoning techniques
and their applications, covering logical and probabilistic approaches. Topics
include: logical and probabilistic foundations, backtracking strategies and
algorithms behind modern SAT solvers, stochastic local search and Markov Chain
Monte Carlo algorithms, classes of reasoning tasks and reductions, and
applications.

Preliminaries
-------------

1.  [Introduction](preliminaries/introduction/) What is automated reasoning and
    how can it help us solve problems? Overview of the course.

Logical Reasoning
-----------------

1.  [Propositional Logic](logic/propositional/): Definitions, CNF form,
    satisfiability

Probabilistic Reasoning
-----------------------
