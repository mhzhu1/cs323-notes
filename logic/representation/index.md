title: 'Representation - propositional logic'
---

We begin our course by studying propositional logic. After we introduce
the definitions, we will discuss satisfiability in propositional logic
and then move on to state of the art techniques to solve systems
specified with propositional logic.

# Definitions

Propositional logic is a formal language used to specify knowledge in a
mathematically rigorous way. We first define the syntax (grammar) and
then the semantics (meaning) of sentences in propositional logic.

## Syntax

We denote our propositional variables by $$p_{1},...,p_{n}$$ where each
$$p_{i}$$ is a binary variable that can be true or false.

Sentences are defined recursively as follows:
-   A propositional variable is a sentence (this is known as an
    atomic sentence)
-   If $$\alpha$$ and $$\beta$$ are sentences, then $$\neg\alpha$$,
    $${\left(\alpha\lor\beta\right)}$$, and
    $${\left(\alpha\land\beta\right)}$$ are valid sentences

For example,
$${\left({\left({\alpha}\lor\beta\right)}\land{\alpha}\right)}$$ is a
valid sentence while $${\left({\alpha}\lor\beta\land{\alpha}\right)}$$
isnâ€™t a valid sentence.

## Semantics

We have to define the notion of a world. A world $${\omega}$$ is an
assignment of a truth value to each propositional variable. Note that
there are $$2^{n}$$ possible worlds if we have $$n$$ propositional
variables.

We determine if a sentence $${\alpha}$$ is true in a world $${\omega}$$
using the following recursive rules:
-   $${\omega}\models p_{i}$$ if and only if $${\omega}(p_{i})$$ is true
-   $${\omega}\models\neg{\alpha}$$ if and only if
    $${\omega}\not\models{\alpha}$$
-   $${\omega}\models{\left({\alpha}\lor\beta\right)}$$ if and only if
    ($${\omega}\models{\alpha}$$) OR ($${\omega}\models\beta$$)
-   $${\omega}\models{\left({\alpha}\land\beta\right)}$$ if and only if
    ($${\omega}\models{\alpha}$$) AND ($${\omega}\models\beta$$)
-   (Note that $${\alpha}\Rightarrow\beta$$ is syntactic sugar for
    $$\neg\alpha\lor\beta$$, and we can use the rules above)

For example, $${\left({\alpha}\lor\neg{\alpha}\right)}$$ is true in any
world while $${\left({\alpha}\land\neg{\alpha}\right)}$$ is never true in
any world.

## Knowledge Base

![By adding $$\Delta$$ to our KB $$\Gamma$$, the number of possible worlds
can (i) decrease, (ii) go to zero, or (iii) remain the
same.](kb.png){width="1\columnwidth"}

A knowledge base is a collection of sentences
$${\alpha}_{1},{\alpha}_{2},...,{\alpha}_{k}$$ that we know are true, i.e.
$${\alpha}_{1}\land{\alpha}_{2}\land...\land{\alpha}_{k}$$. The sentences
in the knowledge base allows us to compactly specify the allowable
states of the world. By adding new sentences, the number of possible
worlds consistent with our knowledge base could decrease (if we gain new
information), go to zero (if the new sentence is inconsistent with the
existing knowledge base), or remain the same (if the new sentence is
entailed by existing sentences).

We will make use of the following definitions:
-   A sentence is satisfiable (consistent) if there exists at least one
    world that makes the sentence true, i.e. $$Models({\alpha})\ne\phi$$.
-   A sentence is valid if the sentence is true in every possible
    world, i.e. $$Models({\alpha})={\Omega}=\{0,1\}^{n}$$.
-   Two sentences are equivalent if they are true in the same
    models, e.g. $${\alpha}\lor\beta$$ and $$\beta\lor\alpha$$.

# Satisfiability

## Inference reduces to satisfiability

The basic inference problem in the propositional logic system is the
following: given the knowledge that we have about the world, is it the
case that some property must always hold? In other words, what
conclusion can we reach about some other sentence? The three possible
cases that could result are always true, depends, and always false.

Inference problem: Does $${\alpha}\Rightarrow\beta$$? We can solve this by
checking if $${\alpha}\land\neg\beta$$ is satisfiable.
1.  If not satisfiable, then we know that $${\alpha}\Rightarrow\beta$$.
    This is similar to the idea behind proof by contradiction.
2.  If satisfiable, then there are two possible cases. Check if
    $${\alpha}\land\beta$$ is satisfiable. If $${\alpha}\land\beta$$ is
    satisfiable, then there is no definitive answer. If
    $${\alpha}\land\beta$$ is not satisfiable, then we know that
    $${\alpha}\Rightarrow\neg\beta$$.

Many problems across different domains can be encoded using
propositional logic. Inference in this space basically boils down to
checking satisfiability. For examples, problems such as solving Sudoku
puzzles, hardware verification, and planning can be encoded as
satisfiability problems and then solved efficiently using state of the
art satisfiability solvers. Since a lot of research has gone into
improving general SAT solvers, if some domain-specific problem has an
efficient transformation into an instance of satisfiability checking,
then SAT solvers can often solve these domain-specific problems
efficiently.

## Conjunctive normal form

To check the satisfiability of a sentence, the first step is to convert
sentences into normal form which is easier for satisfiability solvers to
handle. A sentence is in conjunctive normal form (also known as clausal
norm form or CNF) if a sentence is a conjunction of disjunctions.

Given any formula, we can always convert it into CNF using the following
procedure:
1.  The first step is to remove syntactic sugar, e.g. change
    $${\alpha}\Rightarrow\beta$$ into $$\neg{\alpha}\lor\beta$$. After this
    step, we should only have negations, conjunctions, and disjunctions.
2.  Push negations in. Negations should only appear in front of
    propositional variables. For example, change $$\neg\neg{\alpha}$$ into
    $${\alpha}$$ and $$\neg({\alpha}\lor\beta)$$ into
    $${\left(\neg{\alpha}\land\neg\beta\right)}$$.
3.  Distribute disjunctions over conjunctions, e.g. change
    $${\alpha}\lor(\beta\land\gamma)$$ into
    $$({\alpha}\lor\beta)\land({\alpha}\lor\gamma)$$. (Note that
    converting a sentence which is composed of many disjunctions of
    conjunctions into CNF using this procedure can create an exponential
    number of clauses.)

Checking if an assignment satisfies a CNF formula is easy. A clause is
satisfiable if and only if at least one of the literals (a variable or
the negation of a variable) is set to true. A sentence is satisfiable if
and only if each clause is satisfiable.

Suppose we want to test the satisfiability of a formula $$\Delta$$ in CNF.
Consider what happens when we set a propositional variable $$P$$ to true.
If P does not belong to a given clause, then that clause is unaffected.
If P belongs to a given clause, then that clause becomes satisfied and
we can remove that clause from the formula. The resulting formula can be
expressed as
$$\Delta\vert P=\{\alpha\backslash\{\neg P\}\mid\alpha\in\Delta,P\notin\alpha\}$$.
