Probabilistic graphical modeling is a branch of machine learning that studies how to use probability distributions to describe the world and to make useful predictions about it.

## Probabilistic modeling

But what is, exactly, probabilistic modeling? When trying to solve a real-world problem using mathematics, it is very common to define a mathematical model of the world in the form of an equation.
Perhaps the simplest model would be a linear equation of the form

{% math %}
y = \beta^T x,
{% endmath %}
