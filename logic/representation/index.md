Probabilistic graphical modeling is a branch of machine learning that studies how to use probability distributions to describe the world and to make useful predictions about it.

## Probabilistic modeling

But what is, exactly, probabilistic modeling? When trying to solve a real-world problem using mathematics, it is very common to define a mathematical model of the world in the form of an equation.
Perhaps the simplest model would be a linear equation of the form

\begin{eqnarray*}

{3j \choose j} & = & \frac{(3j)!}{(2j)!j!}\

 & \geq & \frac{c\sqrt{2\pi3j}}{\sqrt{2\pi j}\sqrt{2\pi2j}}(\frac{3j}{e}){3j}(\frac{e}{2j}){2j}(\frac{e}{j})^{j}\

 & = & \frac{a}{\sqrt{j}}(\frac{27}{4})^{j}

\end{eqnarray*}
